## What's **not** included:
1. Wallpapers and other resources
   - I made them pretty easily with a program I wrote in C that scales, [dithers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lseR6ZguBNY&t=1385s), then colors an image. It uses the [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) library for file operations. I'll probably make a repo for it when it's more complete.
2. Neovim config
   - It's just [nvchad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) with a custom [EGA theme](ega.lua).
